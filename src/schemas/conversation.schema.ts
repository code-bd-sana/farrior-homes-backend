/**
 * @fileoverview Conversation MongoDB schema.
 *
 * A Conversation represents a chat thread between two or more participants.
 * It stores a lightweight snapshot of the last message so conversation
 * list screens don't need to join with the messages collection.
 *
 * KEY DESIGN DECISIONS:
 * - participants stores ObjectId refs to the User collection.
 * - lastMessage / lastMessageAt are denormalised for efficient list queries.
 * - Socket.IO room IDs are NOT stored here. Rooms are derived at runtime:
 *     room = `conversation:${conversationId}`
 *
 * INDEXES:
 * - { participants: 1 }   → find all conversations a user belongs to
 * - { lastMessageAt: -1 } → sort conversation list by most recent activity
